> Do not seek to follow the footsteps of the men of old.  Seek what they sought." --Basho

Thanks for reading my blog.  In all honesty, this started as a technical exercise to experience HTML/CSS/Jekyll/GitHub Pages/etc. and turned into a fun project for putting out information which I hope helps make other lives a bit easier.  It's a simple collection of thoughts and information I've found but had a hard time finding elsewhere and which I hope is of use to others.

I'm just some guy in Colorado working in the tech industry wanting to create a better world for tomorrow and hoping to leave a mark, however impermanent, of goodness and inspiration.

I hope you find this content useful or insightful or entertaining and perhaps, make some of your own to pay it forward.

Thanks for reading.
