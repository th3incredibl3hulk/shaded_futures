This is my first post in Jekyll!  I actually heard about this blogging tech from [@jackrhysider][Jack Rhysider], the infosec guru that he is.  He uses it for his own personal blog and I decided to give it a whirl for me as well. I've never found another piece of tech that gives good functionality and also minimal upkeep needed.

So far, I've only played with the basic setup and this post!  Going to explore some formatting next!  Not sure what aesthetic I want yet so we'll see what the internet has to offer.
