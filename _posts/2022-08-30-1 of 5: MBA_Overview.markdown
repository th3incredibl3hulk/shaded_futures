## Overview
Firstly, you must consider WHY you want an MBA.  Truth be told, when I started this journey I was convinced I wanted an MBA purely because my dad had not attained one and my uncles had.  I wanted to let my degree boast of my superiority like a childish 29 year old wanting to leave a mark on the world.

As I explored an MBA, critically, I asked as many people as I knew had an MBA what their experience was like, what advice they would offer, if they'd repeat the experience, etc.  Most of them immediately asked me my explanation for seeking an MBA and I quickly realized it was paper thin.  They made me stop and think about the reasons and really confront if I was buying a piece of paper or something more.


## Reasoning
Reasons I've heard for seeking an MBA can vary quite widely but I recommend you stop on this journey and really consider yours.  Some of the explanations I've heard:
* <b>Degree Prestige:</b> Good, bad or otherwise, having an MBA from a prestigious university gives one an impermeable business wisdom that earthly beings cannot comprehend.  One enters a nirvanic plane where Business Buddha resides and achieves true alpha-return enlightenment.  Not really but it does look good on a resume.  Note the prestige factor weighs less for MBAs outside Top 25 schools in my experience.

* <b>Changing careers:</b> A very common reason is that many people want to change careers drastically later in life.  For example, someone in Marketing that wants to switch to a career in Finance or an Accountant wanting to do Consulting.  There's legitimacy here as MBAs are ripe with skills for such a change though I recommend selecting a specialized MBA vs a general one if this is your journey.

* <b>Just for the fun of it:</b> Really, MBAs are pretty fun in my opinion.  Undergrad is fun in its own way but much less so academically.  Especially when considering peers in an MBA program are older and more life experienced, you can get into tougher, heartier subjects and get really great exposure from mature professionals.  Of course, you also can get Keg Kevin that is more focused on the social component but hey, they work in leadership often too.  Typically sales leadership but whatever.

* <b>Better job/pay:</b> MBAs generally are [pretty lucrative][mba.com] though [there is research][forbes] suggesting at least prudence there.  Speaking for myself, my income increased dramatically post MBA though I struggle to pinpoint why exactly.  I think it's likely a combination of actually being better at my job and also people THINKING I'm better at my job. That said, I doubt my MBA factors at comp time so I think there is merit to an argument that actual performance improves.

* <b>To improve your performance at your job:</b> And there's always the idea of just being better at business if you work in business.  MBAs give you a chance to meet people of all walks of life (my class had a doctor, small business owner, banker, professional artist and many folks around the world) which rounds out both your people skills and your business acumen.  Getting an MBA to be better at your job is honestly, a good reason.

## Questions You Should Ask
So, now that we've covered some of the many, many reasons one might have, how can you figure out what yours is and thus, use it to select the best fit program?  Here are some questions I suggest you reflect on:
1. What things in my life are important to me?  
* "I want to have financial security for my family"
* "It's important that I'm seen as a leader in my professional career"
* "I want to be a good parent when we plan to have kids in 3 years"
1. What are my short, medium and long term goals?  
* "I want to be a VP in a mid or large size company in the next 5 years"
* "I want a promotion in the next 24 months"
1. What constraints do I have to deal with?
* "I cannot relocate because of my children"
* "I can only study at night because I must continue to earn an income"
1. How much can I really afford for an MBA and what am I trading off?
* "I can afford $50,000 all in for the whole program including travel, books, etc."
* "What's the return on investment in my industry for advanced degrees?"
1. How much time can I really devote to an MBA program?
* "At most, I can devote 15 hours/week before my personal life suffers too much"
* "I will need to have flexible commitments because I travel often for work"
1. How will I practically apply my MBA?
* "I am hoping for a general MBA to move into senior management"
* "I would like a specialized double masters in business and computer science to be a better IT leader"
