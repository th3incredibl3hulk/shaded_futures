>To dream the impossible dream <br>
To fight the unbeatable foe<br>
To bear with unbearable sorrow<br>
To run where the brave dare not go<br><br>
To right the unrightable wrong<br>
To love pure and chase from afar<br>
To try when your arms are too weary<br>
To reach the unreachable star<br><br>
This is my quest<br>
To follow that star<br>
No matter how hopeless<br>
No matter how far<br><br>
To fight for the right<br>
Without question or pause<br>
To be willing to march into Hell<br>
For a heavenly cause<br><br>
And I know if I'll only be true<br>
To this glorious quest<br>
That my hear will lie peaceful and calm<br>
When I'm laid to my rest<br><br>
And the world will be better for this<br>
That one man, scorned and covered with scars<br>
Still strove with his last ounce of courage<br>
To reach the unreachable star.<br>

The Impossible Dream (The Quest)<br>

>I went to the Garden of Love<br>
And saw what I never had seen:  A chapel was built in the midst, where I used to play on the green.<br>
And the gates of the Chapel were shut, and 'Thou Shalt Not' writ over the door<br>
And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys and desires.<br>


The Garden of Love<br>
By William Blake

>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br><br> 
We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of "A Course in Miracles"<br>

>Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.

Aunt May's speech, Spider Man 2<br>
By Alvin Sargent

>We were young, we were merry, we were very very wise,<br>
And the door stood open at our feast,<br>
When there passed us a woman with the West in her eyes,<br>
And a man with his back to the East.<br><br>
O still grew the hearts that were beating so fast,<br>
The loudest voice was still.<br>
The jest died away on our lips as they passed,<br>
And the rays of July struck chill.<br><br>
The cups of red wine turned pale on the board,<br>
The white bread black as soot, <br>
The hound forgot the hand of her lord,<br>
She fell down at his foot.<br><br>
Now let me lie where the dead dog lies,<br>
Ere I sit me down again at a feast,<br>
When there passes a woman with the West in her eyes,<br>
And a man with his back to the East.<br>

Unwelcome<br>
By Mary Elizabeth Coleridge

>Then out spake brave Horatius,<br>
The Captain of the Gate:<br>
“To every man upon this earth<br>
Death cometh soon or late.<br>
And how can man die better<br>
Than facing fearful odds,<br>
For the ashes of his fathers,<br>
And the temples of his gods,<br>
...<br>
“Haul down the bridge, Sir Consul,<br>
With all the speed ye may;<br>
I, with two more to help me,<br>
Will hold the foe in play.<br>
In yon strait path a thousand<br>
May well be stopped by three.<br>
Now who will stand on either hand,<br>
And keep the bridge with me?”<br>

Horatius from Lays of Ancient Rome<br>

>It's easy enough to be pleasant <br>
When life goes by like a song, <br>
But the man worthwhile <br>
Is the man with a smile <br>
When everything goes dead wrong.<br>

Poem by Ella Wheeler Wilcox

>"Even though large tracts of Europe and many old and famous states have fallen or may fall into the grip of the Gestapo and all the odious apparatus of Nazi rule, we shall not flag or fail.<br>
<br>
"We shall go on to the end, we shall fight in France, we shall fight on the seas and oceans, we shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air, we shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.<br>
<br>
"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender, and even if, which I do not for a moment believe, this island or a large part of it were subjugated and starving, then our Empire beyond the seas, armed and guarded by the British fleet, would carry on the struggle, until, in God's good time, the new world, with all its power and might, steps forth to the rescue and the liberation of the old."<br>

Winston Churchill<br>
Speech to the House of Commons - 4 June 1940

>Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home:<br>
Thou art not my friend, and I'm not thine.<br>
Long through thy weary crowds I roam;<br>
A river-ark on the ocean brine,<br>
Long I've been tossed like the driven foam;<br>
But now, proud world! I'm going home.<br><br>
Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face;<br>
To Grandeur with his wise grimace;<br>
To upstart Wealth's averted eye;<br>
To supple Office, low and high;<br>
To crowded halls, to court and street;<br>
To frozen hearts and hasting feet;<br>
To those who go, and those who come;<br>
Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home.<br><br>
I am going to my own hearth-stone,<br>
Bosomed in yon green hills alone, —<br>
A secret nook in a pleasant land,<br>
Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;<br>
Where arches green, the livelong day,<br>
Echo the blackbird's roundelay,<br>
And vulgar feet have never trod<br>
A spot that is sacred to thought and God.<br><br>
O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,<br>
I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome;<br>
And when I am stretched beneath the pines,<br>
Where the evening star so holy shines,<br>
I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,<br>
At the sophist schools, and the learned clan;<br>
For what are they all, in their high conceit,<br>
When man in the bush with God may meet? <br>

Good-Bye<br>
By Ralph Waldo Emerson

I knew a simple soldier boy<br>
Who grinned at life in empty joy,<br>
Slept soundly through the lonesome dark,<br>
And whistled early with the lark.<br><br>
In winter trenches, cowed and glum,<br>
With crumps and lice and lack of rum,<br>
He put a bullet through his brain.<br>
No one spoke of him again.<br><br>
You smug-faced crowds with kindling eye<br>
Who cheer when soldier lads march by,<br>
Sneak home and pray you'll never know<br>
The hell where youth and laughter go.<br>

Suicide in the Trenches<br>
S. Sassoon
