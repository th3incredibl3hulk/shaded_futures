>To dream the impossible dream <br>
To fight the unbeatable foe<br>
To bear with unbearable sorrow<br>
To run where the brave dare not go<br><br>
To right the unrightable wrong<br>
To love pure and chase from afar<br>
To try when your arms are too weary<br>
To reach the unreachable star<br><br>
This is my quest<br>
To follow that star<br>
No matter how hopeless<br>
No matter how far<br><br>
To fight for the right<br>
Without question or pause<br>
To be willing to march into Hell<br>
For a heavenly cause<br><br>
And I know if I'll only be true<br>
To this glorious quest<br>
That my hear will lie peaceful and calm<br>
When I'm laid to my rest<br><br>
And the world will be better for this<br>
That one man, scorned and covered with scars<br>
Still strove with his last ounce of courage<br>
To reach the unreachable star.<br>

The Impossible Dream (The Quest)<br>

>I went to the Garden of Love<br>
And saw what I never had seen:  A chapel was built in the midst, where I used to play on the green.<br>
And the gates of the Chapel were shut, and 'Thou Shalt Not' writ over the door<br>
And priests in black gowns were walking their rounds and binding with briars my joys and desires.<br>


The Garden of Love<br>
By William Blake

>Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us. We ask ourselves, 'Who am I to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, fabulous?' Actually, who are you not to be? You are a child of God. Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people won't feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do.<br><br> 
We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It's not just in some of us; it's in everyone. And as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give other people permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others.

A Return to Love: Reflections on the Principles of "A Course in Miracles"

>Everybody loves a hero. People line up for them, cheer them, scream their names. And years later, they'll tell how they stood in the rain for hours just to get a glimpse of the one who taught them how to hold on a second longer. I believe there's a hero in all of us, that keeps us honest, gives us strength, makes us noble, and finally allows us to die with pride, even though sometimes we have to be steady, and give up the thing we want the most. Even our dreams.

Aunt May's speech, Spider Man 2<br>
By Alvin Sargent

>We were young, we were merry, we were very very wise,<br>
And the door stood open at our feast,<br>
When there passed us a woman with the West in her eyes,<br>
And a man with his back to the East.<br><br>
O still grew the hearts that were beating so fast,<br>
The loudest voice was still.<br>
The jest died away on our lips as they passed,<br>
And the rays of July struck chill.<br><br>
The cups of red wine turned pale on the board,<br>
The white bread black as soot, <br>
The hound forgot the hand of her lord,<br>
She fell down at his foot.<br><br>
Now let me lie where the dead dog lies,<br>
Ere I sit me down again at a feast,<br>
When there passes a woman with the West in her eyes,<br>
And a man with his back to the East.<br>

Unwelcome<br>

>Then out spake brave Horatius,<br>
The Captain of the Gate:<br>
“To every man upon this earth<br>
Death cometh soon or late.<br>
And how can man die better<br>
Than facing fearful odds,<br>
For the ashes of his fathers,<br>
And the temples of his gods,<br>
...<br>
“Haul down the bridge, Sir Consul,<br>
With all the speed ye may;<br>
I, with two more to help me,<br>
Will hold the foe in play.<br>
In yon strait path a thousand<br>
May well be stopped by three.<br>
Now who will stand on either hand,<br>
And keep the bridge with me?”<br>

Horatius from Lays of Ancient Rome<br>
By Thomas Babington Macaulay<br>
